git-chrono is like Perforce's Time Lapse View, but it works with git.

You will need Tcl/Tk 8.5 in order to run it. It will not with with 8.4. Tcl/Tk 8.5 is the default on MacOS 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and 10.7 (Lion).

To install, put all the files into a directory, then add that directory to your path. Alternatively, create a symlink to `git-chrono` in some directory that is already on your path (`~/bin` perhaps).
